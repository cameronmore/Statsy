## Quickstart

To use statsy, install from PyPi:

```
pip install statsy
```

From there, in your own `Scripy.py` file, import statsy and use normally:

```
from statsy import *

summation( i = 1 , range = 4 , lamda x: x+1 , [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]])
```

Alternatively, you may import it under an alias:

```
import statsy as sty

sty.summation( i = 1 , range = 4 , lamda x: x+1 , [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]])
```

For a proper guide on usage, stay tuned.
